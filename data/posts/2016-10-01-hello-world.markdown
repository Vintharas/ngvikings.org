### Hello world from ngVikings!

ngVikings are a series of community-driven events across the Nordic countries. Our talks and workshops will be mostly about Angular and other technologies related to the Angular framework. Our goal is to strengthen the Angular community in the Nordics by bringing it together, while inspiring and learning from each other. Nothing fuels collaboration like meetings in real life.

The first ngVikings event is scheduled for the 11th & 12th of February in Copenhagen, Denmark. This event will gather 300+ front-end developers from different Nordic countries together in Copenhagen. It will also be the first Angular conference hosted in the Nordic countries.

ngVikings is a 100% community-driven event comprised of many Nordic Angular groups such as:
* AngularJS Copenhagen
* GDG Copenhagen
* AngularJS Oslo
* AngularJS Gothenburg
* ngAarhus
* ngStockholm
* Angular Finland
