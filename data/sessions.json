You will learn about approaches for internationalization and about modern authentication scenarios with OAuth 2 and OpenId Connect that allow for single sign on as well as for an integration into existing identity systems like Active Directory. In addition to that, you will also get to know some strategies to drastically improve your application performance, like using observables and immutables for data binding and leveraging the AOT compiler as well as tree shaking. In addition to that, you will find out how to use lazy loading and preloading together with webpack and how to use other advanced routing techniques, like aux routes, router events and guards.",

Instead we will focus on the hard parts of creating a scalable application that is maintainable and snappy. We will teach you how to use Smart vs Dumb components, RxJS, NGRX/Store and much more in real world applications. The focus lies on principles, architectural choices and best practices. And of course CODING! We do this by switching theory with coding sessions where you have to code parts of the application yourself. We refactor a non-reactive application towards a reactive application during the workshop. At the end, we will demonstrate the flexibility of the application by making it realtime in only 6 lines of code!",

But, just because you can share code across multiple platforms, doesn’t mean that you necessarily should. In this talk we’ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. We’ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then we’ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments.",
